# Recommendation-System-using-Tableau

The current scenario is that Customer data platform team is sending email notification regarding price drops in the vehicle for which the customer has shown interest for. This is done at a daily cadence, i.e., one email per day irrespective of no. of price drops The final outcome is that I have to build a dashboard using Tableau that will provide recommendations of a Vehicle based on the customer interests.

Overview and Analysis Screen-

The first screen contains filter for Regions, sub region, language and timeframe. On selecting timeframe dropdown list we can select different model years (i.e. 2018,2019,2020) and accordingly visuals data will change. The first graph shows the graph between offer price and brand of vehicle. The other graph shows the vehicles sales for a particular brand. On the right side there is a USA map showing in which region what brand is sold more and preferred by the resident. The last graph is for which body type is popular more.

Simulator Screen-
 
The second screen displays the average offer price and vehicle sales. The brand list shows options for different brands and after selecting we will get the data for that particular brand in the bar plot graph with the vehicle description, model year and consumer Id in the table. After selecting the bar for that brand the recommend button will get activated and once clicking that button it will drill through to the third screen.
